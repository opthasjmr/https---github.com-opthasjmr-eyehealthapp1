# Environment variables for your running application.
# GOOGLE_API_KEY is required for Genkit to function.
# For production, it's highly recommended to use Google Cloud Secret Manager
# to store sensitive values like API keys.
env:
  # Example using Google Cloud Secret Manager (RECOMMENDED for API keys):
  - variable: GOOGLE_API_KEY
    # Replace 'YOUR_SECRET_NAME_HERE' with the name of your secret in Google Cloud Secret Manager
    # e.g., BLOOMVERSE_GOOGLE_API_KEY or GENKIT_API_KEY
    secret: YOUR_SECRET_NAME_HERE
  # Remove or comment out the direct value if you were using it:
  # - variable: GOOGLE_API_KEY
  #   value: "YOUR_OLD_API_KEY_WAS_HERE"

  # You can add other environment variables your app needs here.
  # - variable: ANOTHER_VARIABLE
  #   value: "its_value"
